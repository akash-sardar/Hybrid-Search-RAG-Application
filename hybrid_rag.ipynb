Many more consumers are using life and \\nannuity products as part of their financial planning goals  .  \\nConsumers spend substantial sums of money each year on \\nlife insurance policies or annuity contracts knowing very little about what it is that they are getting  .  This guide was \\ndeveloped to help consumers make educated decisions and \\nto help them understand both the benefits and the risks involved in financial planning  .\\nThe purpose of this information guide is to help you \\nunderstand what type of life insurance policies or annuity contracts are available  .  If one type of policy or contract \\ndoes not fit your needs, then ask and find out about \\nother available policies or contracts, many of which are described in this information guide  .
